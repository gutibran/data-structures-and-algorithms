# data structures and algorithms
Everything that I currently known about data structures and algorithms. I have from-scratch implementations of data structures and algorithms written in C, C++, and Python for educational purposes. Built-in data structures usage examples are also included in those languages for practical usage. Everything should have LaTeX documents for written notes and analysis. There will be a script to compile the LaTeX into a single PDF (will work on this later).
 
 The competitive programming sections is me applying what I've learned to improve problem solving, improving algorithmic analysis, proofs, explaining problem solving process, and to become comptent enough to pass a technical interview. Will update and condense this README.md later.
